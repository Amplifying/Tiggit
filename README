The TIGGIT indie game installer
-------------------------------

This is an alpha version of a new game installer / distribution /
thingie I'm working on.

For more info, check out http://tiggit.net/ .

This source code is currently messy, undocumented, early prototypish
and not for the faint of heart. And there are NO build instructions,
but you should be able to get going with CMake.

Still, if you want to improve tiggit, all help and suggestions are
highly welcome.

Send me a mail at korslund@gmail.com or send pull requests through github.
