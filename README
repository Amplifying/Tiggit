The TIGGIT indie game installer
-------------------------------

This is an alpha version of a new game installer / distribution /
thingie I'm working on.

For (slightly) more info, check out http://tiggit.net/ .

The source code is messy, undocumented, early prototypish and not for
the faint of heart. Oh, and there are NO build instructions. Enjoy :)
