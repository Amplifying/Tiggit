This module transports various data to and from JSON and other
formats.

Files will typically only depend on the data structures they
manipulates, and the appropriate library for the serialized format,
such as jsoncpp for JSON.

Submodules:

tigdata_json.hpp/cpp - reads tigdata/ structures from JSON
